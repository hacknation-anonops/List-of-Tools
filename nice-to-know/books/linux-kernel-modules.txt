						THE LINUX KERNEL MODULES PROGRAMMING TUTORIAL

Author: Ormi <ormi.ormi@gmail.com>
Website: http://black-coders.net

In this tutorial, I'm going to teach you how to write linux kernel modules. Unfortunately(or fortunately) it is necessary you to know C programming
language. So if you can't programm in C, don't waste time and don't read this tutorial - you won't understand it :)

You will probably ask - "So, what the hell is that linux kernel module?". As explained in [1] - it is a piece of code that can be dynamically
loaded and unloaded from the kernel. Oh, maybe you don't know what kernel is. It is main part of each operating system. It is "program" that is loaded
and executed by bootloader at the boot time. Kernel manages all system resources. It's responsible for communication between software and hardware,
manages all user's processes and many, many more. For more information you can see [2]. In this tutorial, we're talking only about linux kernel :) 

Kernel and user mode processes run in different privilege levels. New processors support it i.e. Intel processors have the following privilege
levels:
ring0(the most "powerful" privilege level)
ring1
ring2
ring3(the least "powerful" privilege level)
Linux uses only two of them - ring0 for kernel and ring3 for user mode proceses. You can ask - "What are these privilege levels used for?".
If user mode processes ran in ring0, they would be able to execute some "destructive" code. For example they could execute "cli" processor command.
It would stop all hardware interrupts and as a result stop whole kernel! It would be very bad for safety of the system. That's why only kernel
runs in ring0 and user mode processes in ring3 - when they run in ring3 they can't do anything bad to the kernel.

The main power of linux kernel modules is that they run in ring0(kernel mode), not like normal processes in ring3(user mode). Of course only root can load
them :) Why are they useful? For example, there can be a situation when we have some hardware and unfortunately we haven't drivers for it compiled
into the kernel. Then, kernel modules can help us. Kernel module can be driver for that hardware. We can load such a kernel module and then we can normally
use our hardware. Without kernel module, it would be necessary to recompile the kernel with support for this hardware. And it takes really long time...

How to load modules? Modules are usually files with ".ko" extension. All we need to do is to execute command(as root):
insmod module.ko
The module was loaded. But after some time we will want to unload the module. How to do this? We execute(again as root):
rmmod module
or
rmmod module.ko
Both ways are correct :)

OK. Now we know what linux kernel modules are, why they are useful and how to load them. We can write a simple module then.
It will be standard "Hello world!" module. Read comments in the code - they explain many things.

----------------

/* These are "standard" module include files */
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

/* This function will be executed when we load the module */
int __init mod_init(void)
{
	/* Now we see "printk" function. This is something like
	standard printf in C. But we are working in kernel mode
	so we can't use functions used by user mode programs.
	I will give more information about this function right
	after the code of this module */
	printk(KERN_ALERT "Hello world!\n");

	return 0;
}

/* This function will be executed when we unload the module */
void __exit mod_exit(void)
{
	printk(KERN_ALERT "Bye world\n");
}


/* Here we "register" mod_init and mod_exit */

/* mod_init and mod_exit functions can have different names - they only have to be "registered" by module_init and module_exit macros */

/* As a parameter of module_init we give function that has to be executed during loading of the module */
module_init(mod_init);

/* As a parameter of module_exit we give function that has to be executed during unloading of the module */
module_exit(mod_exit);

----------------------------

As promised, I will explain printk function now. First thing - if you want to "normally" see what printk writes you must load and unload module
not in X but from standard tty console.
So - printk just writes given text to the screen. If you load module in X mode you won't see what printk wrote. However you can still see it
by executing command
dmesg
However, printk was not meant to communicate with user. It is rather used as a logging mechanism. KERN_ALERT is a priority of message to be logged.
There are 8 priorities levels - each level has its own macro. If value of used priority is lower(the lower value it has, the more important is the message)
than console_loglevel, the message is written to the screen. You can see all macros in linux/kernel.h file(this is relative path from root kernel's source
code directory).

How to compile such a module? We use a special Makefile:
--------------------

obj-m += hello.o
all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=${PWD} modules
clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=${PWD} clean

-------------------

I assume that your file with source code of our module is hello.c
Now we execute:
make
OK. We have hello.ko file. Load it as root from tty console
insmod hello.ko

You should see:
Hello world!

Now you can unload this module:
rmmod hello

You should see:
Bye world!

You should also include MODULE_LICENSE, MODULE_AUTHOR and MODULE_DESCRIPTION macros.
MODULE_LICENSE specifies what license is used for this module.
MODULE_AUTHOR specifies who author of this module is.
MODULE_DESCRIPTION is a short description of what the module does.
Let's see modified module:

-----------

/* These are "standard" module include files */
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Ormi <ormi.ormi@gmail.com>");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Hello world module ;)");

/* This is function that will be executed when we load the module */
int __init mod_init(void)
{
	/* Now we see "printk" function. This is something like
	standard printf in C. But we are working in kernel mode
	so we can't use functions used by user mode programs.
	I will give more information about this function right
	after the code of this module */
	printk(KERN_ALERT "Hello world!\n");

	return 0;
}

/* This function will be executed when we unload the module */
void __exit mod_exit(void)
{
	printk(KERN_ALERT "Bye world\n");
}


/* Here we "register" mod_init and mod_exit */

/* As a parameter of module_init we give function that has to be executed during loading of the module */
module_init(mod_init);

/* As a parameter of module_exit we give function that has to be executed during unloading of the module */
module_exit(mod_exit);

-------------------------------

Let's compile it again:
make
Now we can see some information about module. Execute command:
modinfo hello.ko

We can see something like this:

filename:       hello.ko
description:    Hello world module ;)
author:         Ormi <ormi.ormi@gmail.com>
license:        GPL
srcversion:     0B4C5D175084D60DBC22242
depends:        
vermagic:       2.6.28-11-generic SMP mod_unload modversions 586 

One day we will write a module, which source code will be too big to fit in one file. For example it can fit in two files:
one.c
two.c

How to compile it into one module? We can use such a Makefile:

----------------------

obj-m += big.o
big-objs += one.o two.o

all:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=${PWD} modules
clean:
	make -C /lib/modules/$(shell uname -r)/build M=${PWD} clean

-------------------


When we compile it with "make" command, we will get big.ko file which is our module :)

Now you can do some experiments with our modules, try creating something bigger. You should make sure that you became with things,
which I have already desribed, because now we are moving to something more complicated.
If you didn't understand what I wrote you can have problems with next things.

									PROCFS

Linux has a nice feature that helps kernel and modules to communicate with processes - procfs. In most distributions you can find it in
/proc directory. There are sub-directories for all processes and some other "files"(for example /proc/version, which gives us informations about
kernel's version). In this section I will show how to create "files" or "entries" in procfs.

I will explain what functions and structures we need for our module.

1. struct proc_dir_entry
Each entry in procfs is represented by its own proc_dir_entry structure. Let's take a look at definition of this structure:

----------------------

struct proc_dir_entry {
        unsigned int low_ino;
        unsigned short namelen;
        const char *name;
        mode_t mode;
        nlink_t nlink;
        uid_t uid;
        gid_t gid;
        loff_t size;
        const struct inode_operations *proc_iops;
        const struct file_operations *proc_fops;
        struct proc_dir_entry *next, *parent, *subdir;
        void *data;
        read_proc_t *read_proc;
        write_proc_t *write_proc;
        atomic_t count;
        int pde_users;
        spinlock_t pde_unload_lock;
        struct completion *pde_unload_completion;
        struct list_head pde_openers;
};

--------------------------

We are interested only in following fields:
name - name of entry in profs
mode - who can access the entry(for example 777)
read_proc - pointer to function that manages reading from this file. Let's look at prototype:
typedef int (read_proc_t)(char *page, char **start, off_t off,
                          int count, int *eof, void *data);
Here we are interested only in page and count arguments.
page is pointer to user mode buffer into which we have to write data
count - how many bytes can be written there.


write_proc - pointer to function that manages writing to this file. Prototype:
typedef int (write_proc_t)(struct file *file, const char __user *buffer,
                           unsigned long count, void *data);
We are interested only in buffer and count fields.
buffer is pointer to user mode buffer containing data which has to be written to our entry.
count - size of this buffer

OK. that's all I wanted to say about proc_dir_entry.

2. create_proc_entry function.
Let's look at its prototype:

extern struct proc_dir_entry *create_proc_entry(const char *name, mode_t mode, struct proc_dir_entry *parent);

name - name of entry to be created
mode - this value will be written to mode field of proc_dir_entry structure of create entry
parent - in which sub-directory of /proc we want to create our entry. We give 0 here, because we want to create our entry directly in /proc.

This function returns pointer to proc_dir_entry representing out entry in procfs.

What will our module do?
1. It will create entry named "test_proc".
2. It will have a special buffer our_buf where it will store some data.
3. When user writes to our entry(for example by command "echo hello > /proc/test_proc"), data written to this file will be stored in our_buf.
4. When user reads from our entry(for example by command "cat /proc/test_proc"), module will "show" him content of our_buf.

Next functions we need:
1. sprintf and snprintf(they are used as standard sprintf and snprintf for user mode programs)
2. copy_from_user(void *dst, void *src, int count)
This function is used to copy data from user mode buffer(src) to our kernel mode buffer(dst). "count" bytes are copied.
3. remove_proc_entry(char *name, struct proc_dir_entry *parent)
name - name of entry we want to delete
parent - in which sub-directory of /proc entry, which we want to delete, is located. We give 0 here, because we want to delete entry in /proc.

Now let's take a look at code of our module:

----------

/* Standard includes for modules */
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/init.h>

/* for proc_dir_entry and create_proc_entry */
#include <linux/proc_fs.h>

/* For sprintf and snprintf */
#include <linux/string.h>

/* For copy_from_user */
#include <linux/uaccess.h>

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL");
MODULE_AUTHOR("Ormi <ormi.ormi@gmail.com>");
MODULE_DESCRIPTION("Simple module using procfs");

static char our_buf[256];

int buf_read(char *buf, char **start, off_t offset, int count, int *eof, void *data)
{
	int len;
	/* For example - when content of our_buf is "hello" - when user executes command "cat /proc/test_proc"
	he will see content of our_buf(in our example "hello" */
	len = snprintf(buf, count, "%s", our_buf);
	return len;
}

/* When user writes to our entry. For example "echo "aa" > /proc/test_ptoc". "aa" will be stored in our_buf.
Then, when user reads from our entry(cat /proc/test_proc) he will see "aa" */
static int buf_write(struct file *file, const char *buf, unsigned long count, void *data)
{
	/* If count is bigger than 255, data which user wants to write is too big to fit in our_buf. We don't want
	any buffer overflows, so we read only 255 bytes */	
	if(count > 255)
		count = 255;
	/* Here we read from buf to our_buf */
	copy_from_user(our_buf, buf, count);
	/* we write NULL to end the string */
	our_buf[count] = '\0';
	return count;
}

int __init start_module(void)
{

	/* We create our entry */	
	struct proc_dir_entry *de = create_proc_entry("test_proc", 0666, 0);

	/* Set pointers to our functions reading and writing */
	de->read_proc = buf_read;
	de->write_proc = buf_write;

	/* We initialize our_buf with some text. */
	sprintf(our_buf, "hello");

	return 0 ;
}

void __exit exit_module(void)
{
	/* We delete our entry */
	remove_proc_entry("test_proc", NULL);
}

module_init(start_module);
module_exit(exit_module);

-------

Now, edit Makefile and change hello.o to proc.o(if file with source code of this module is written as proc.c) and compile.
make
Then load module.
insmod proc.ko
And test our module ;)

								NOTIFIERS

Next thing, I want to write about, is something called "notify chains". There are some events, which are quite important, and when they occur some kernel
sub-systems want to be informed about that. Here notify chains come to help us.
We will use some keyboard events as an example and then we will write our first, doing-something module :) So:
when user presses a key, kernel "reads" it and then, using notify chain informs all subsystems which want to be informed about pressed key.
One of the structures used by notifiers is notifier_block
Let's look at the definition:

-----------

struct notifier_block {
        int (*notifier_call)(struct notifier_block *self, unsigned long x, void *data);
        struct notifier_block *next;
        int priority;
};

-------

This structure is used to register in notify chains. notifier_call is pointer to function which is called when an event occurs. Priority informs about
priority of that function. Functions with higher priorities are called earlier. However, this field is usually set to 0.
next is pointer to next registered notifier_block.

So:
1. An event occurs.
2. Kernel "looks" at head of list of notifier_blocks and executes first registered function. Then it goes where pointer "next" points and executes function.
Then it goes again to next and again executes function.

So how can a module register in (for example) keyboard notify chain?
1. It creates a notifier_block structure and initializes it. For example:

struct notifier_block nb;
nb.notifier_call = function
Where "function" is function which has to be executed when an event occurs(in our example - when a key is pressed).

2. Registers by register_keyboard_notifer(struct notifier_block *nb) . In our example:
register_keyboard_notifier(&nb);
Ready! :)

We have to write function which will handle situation when a key is pressed. What are its parameters? As in the prototype:
(struct notifier_block *self, unsigned long stage, void *data);
self - pointer to our notifier_block - we don't use it
stage - stage of "handling" the pressed key. We do something only when stage is KBD_KEYSYM.
data - pointer to keyboard_notifier_param structure.
In this structure we are interested only in value field. It stores the value of pressed key. 

Our module will be very simple random numbers generator. It's only a toy and can't be treated seriously :)

----------------------------

/* Standard includes for modules */
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>
#include <linux/init.h>
/* For keyboard_notifier param and other related stuff. */
#include <linux/keyboard.h>
/* notifier_block and related stuff :) */
#include <linux/notifier.h>
/* create_proc_entry and other procfs-related stuff. */
#include <linux/proc_fs.h>
/* sprintf */
#include <linux/string.h>

MODULE_LICENSE("GPL") ;

static unsigned long long random_num ;

/* Our function, which will be executed when a key is pressed */
static int kbd_notify(struct notifier_block *self, unsigned long stage, void *data)
{
	struct keyboard_notifier_param *param = data; /* Pointer to keyboard_notifier_param */
	int value = param->value - 0xf000; /* Value can't be too big */
	/* We calculate our random number by random_num*key_value
	This is really dummy and improfessional, but this module
	only has to show how to use notifiers */	
	/* Value must fit in long long :) */
	if(random_num > 1000000000)
		random_num -= 10*value;	
	else	
		random_num  *= value;
	return NOTIFY_DONE ;
}

/* We prepare our notifier_block structure. kbd_notify is function handling events */
static struct notifier_block kbd_nb = { .notifier_call = kbd_notify, } ;

/* We register in notify chain */
static void handler_init(void)
{
	register_keyboard_notifier(&kbd_nb) ;
}

/* We write this random number to user mode buffer */
static int random_read(char *buf, char **start, off_t off, int count, int *peof, void *data)
{
	int len = sprintf(buf, "%llu", random_num);

	return len ;
}

/* We create entry in procfs */
static void proc_init(void)
{
	struct proc_dir_entry *de = create_proc_entry("random_simple", 0444, 0);
	de->read_proc = random_read;
}

static int __init random_init(void) 
{
	handler_init();
	proc_init();
	random_num = 1;
	

	return 0 ;
}

static void __exit random_exit(void)
{
	remove_proc_entry("random_simple", 0);
	unregister_keyboard_notifier(&kbd_nb);
}


module_init(random_init) ;
module_exit(random_exit) ;

--------------------------------

Now you can compile it and test.

								END

That's all for now. I hope you learned something from this article and became interested in linux kernel. If you want to start browsing kernel's code,
I can give you an advise. I began my adventure with linux kernel by writing linux kernel modules. One day I got an idea to write a simple rootkit.
I wanted my rootkit to be difficult to detect - to achieve this I had to know more organisation of kernel's structures. Firstly, I analysed how
procfs works - how new entries are created etc. Procfs is a relatively easy piece of code. I think, it's good to begin browsing kernel's code there.
You can also buy some books about linux kernel. For example [3], [4] and [5].
Good luck :)
